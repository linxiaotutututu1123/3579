The directory contains:\n\n- HTML files (index.html, app.html)\n- CSS files (styles.css, vendor.css, etc.)\n- JavaScript files (app.js, main.js, vendor.js, etc.)\n- Asset folders (images/, fonts/, icons/)\n\nThis looks like a deployed web application with minified/compiled assets rather than source code. The files appear to be part of a Chinese language web application for experiencing large language models through Volcano Engine's platform.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Analyze the structure of a specific file (HTML, CSS, or JS)?\n2. Look for particular functionality within the codebase?\n3. Help plan modifications or new features for this application?\n\nPlease let me know what you'd like to explore or accomplish with this codebase!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":149,"output_tokens":432,"cache_read_input_tokens":640}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"84cc1e39-9e71-4405-a243-fb8ce02d7a52","timestamp":"2025-12-08T22:06:49.360Z"}
