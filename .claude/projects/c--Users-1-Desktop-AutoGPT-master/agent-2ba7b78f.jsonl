I'm ready to explore the AutoGPT codebase and design implementation plans. This appears to be a large monorepo containing the AutoGPT platform with both backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend components.\n\nI can see from the git status that this is a fresh repository with many files staged for initial commit. The main components appear to be:\n\n1. **autogpt_platform/** - The main platform code\n   - **backend/** - Python backend with FastAPI\n   - **autogpt_libs/** - Shared Python libraries\n   - **frontend/** - Frontend application (likely Next.js based on typical patterns)\n\n2. **classic/** - Likely the original/classic AutoGPT implementation\n\nI'm ready to receive requirements and explore the codebase to design implementation plans.
