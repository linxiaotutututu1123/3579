I'm ready to help you explore the AutoGPT codebase and design implementation plans. This appears to be a large monorepo containing:\n\n1. **AutoGPT Platform** - A modern platform with:\n   - Backend (Python/FastAPI)\n   - Frontend (likely Next.js/React)\n   - Various blocks/integrations for AI agents\n\n2. **Classic AutoGPT** - The original autonomous AI agent\n\nThe git status shows this is a fresh clone with all files staged but not yet committed. The codebase is extensive with hundreds of files across multiple components.\n\nI'm ready to receive your requirements and explore the codebase to design implementation plans.
