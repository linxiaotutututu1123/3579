I'm ready to explore the AutoGPT codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nThis appears to be the AutoGPT repository, which includes:\n- **autogpt_platform/** - The main AutoGPT platform with backend and frontend\n- **classic/** - Classic AutoGPT implementations\n- Various CI/CD workflows and configuration files\n\nI'm operating in **read-only mode** and will only use exploration commands like:\n- `Read` to view file contents\n- `Glob` to find files by pattern\n- `Grep` to search for text patterns\n- `Bash` for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git log, git diff, etc.)\n\nWhen you provide requirements, I will:\n1. Thoroughly explore the relevant parts of the codebase\n2. Identify existing patterns and conventions\n3. Design a detailed implementation plan\n4. List critical files for implementation\n\nPlease provide your requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to apply to the design process.","type":"text"}],"id":"msg_015ALnmEWjukbU4TAGdbh6pv","model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","role":"assistant","stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"type":"message","usage":{"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":14888},"cache_creation_input_tokens":14888,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"input_tokens":2,"output_tokens":232,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"a55eaf40-cefe-446e-ad67-4a60434c1903","timestamp":"2025-12-09T12:44:11.232Z"}
