Here's what I found:\n\n**Key Points:**\n1. **Your settings are correct** - The model is set to `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`\n2. **System display** - The \"oups 4\" appears to be a simplified display from the CLI/UI\n3. **Migration complete** - Both Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 migrations are marked as done in your config\n\n**Possible explanations:**\n- The CLI might be showing a shortened version for display\n- The model you're actually talking to (me) is Sonnet 4.5, as shown in the background info\n- The \"oups 4\" might be a visual indicator or artifact\n\n**Current status:**\n- ✅ Configuration fixed\n- ✅ Opus 4.5 migration completed\n- ⚠️ Display might not reflect actual model in use\n\nThe discrepancy between what's configured and what's displayed might be normal for your setup. The important thing is your configuration is now properly formatted."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":90,"output_tokens":249,"cache_read_input_tokens":20320}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"387036ae-b7a4-43d9-b249-0d6fe5ebd588","timestamp":"2025-12-08T20:53:05.126Z"}
