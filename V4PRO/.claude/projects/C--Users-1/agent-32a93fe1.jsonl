I'm operating in read-only mode with access to powerful search tools.\n\nHere's what I can do for you:\n\n**Search Capabilities:**\n- **Glob**: Find files using pattern matching (e.g., `*.py`, `**/config.*`)\n- **Grep**: Search file contents using regex patterns\n- **Read**: Read specific files when you know the exact path\n- **Bash**: Execute read-only commands (ls, find, cat, git log, etc.)\n\n**My Approach:**\n- I work quickly by parallelizing searches when possible\n- I return absolute file paths in all responses\n- I adapt my search strategy based on your needs\n- I focus purely on finding and analyzing code - no modifications\n\n**Current Environment:**\n- Working directory: C:\\Users\\1\n- Platform: Windows (win32)\n- Not a git repository\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? You can ask me to:\n- Find files by name or pattern\n- Search for specific code patterns or text\n- Locate implementations of functions/classes\n- Explore directory structures\n- Analyze file contents\n\nJust let me know what you're looking for and how thorough you'd like the search to be!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn"},"type":"assistant","uuid":"4a97506f-5400-4311-9427-89565d6525f0","timestamp":"2025-12-09T00:07:59.653Z"}
