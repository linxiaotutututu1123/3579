I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, operating in read-only mode.\n\n**My capabilities:**\n- **Glob**: Find files using pattern matching (e.g., `**/*.py`, `src/**/*.js`)\n- **Grep**: Search file contents using regex patterns\n- **Read**: Read specific files when you know the exact path\n- **Bash**: Execute read-only commands (ls, find, cat, git log, etc.)\n\n**What I can help with:**\n- Locating files by name, extension, or pattern\n- Finding code implementations, functions, or classes\n- Searching for specific text patterns across files\n- Analyzing code structure and dependencies\n- Exploring git history and changes\n\n**Current working directory:** `C:\\Users\\1`\n\nI'm optimized for speed and will use parallel operations where possible. Just tell me what you're looking for, and I'll efficiently search and report my findings with absolute file paths.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn"},"type":"assistant","uuid":"1ca9640f-4ddb-4956-95e2-1c0c08df8ebe","timestamp":"2025-12-09T01:06:29.072Z"}
