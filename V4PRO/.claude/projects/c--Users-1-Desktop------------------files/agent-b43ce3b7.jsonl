Let me start by examining what's in the current directory.\n\n<bash>\nls -la\n</bash>\n\nThis appears to be a directory containing files related to \"火山方舟大模型体验中心-火山引擎\" (Volcano Engine LLM Experience Center). The files seem to be web assets, likely downloaded from a webpage. Let me explore further to understand the structure better.\n\n<bash>\nfind . -type f -name \"*.js\" -o -name \"*.html\" -o -name \"*.css\" | head -20\n</bash>\n\nI can see this is a collection of web assets including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.
