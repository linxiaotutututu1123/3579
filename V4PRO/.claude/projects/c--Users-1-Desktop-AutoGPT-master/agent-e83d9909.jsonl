I'm ready to help you explore the AutoGPT codebase and design implementation plans. This appears to be a large monorepo containing the AutoGPT platform with both backend (Python) and frontend components.\n\nI can see from the git status that this is a fresh repository with many files staged for commit. The main components appear to be:\n\n1. **autogpt_platform/** - The main platform code\n   - **backend/** - Python backend with FastAPI\n   - **autogpt_libs/** - Shared Python libraries\n   - **frontend/** - Next.js frontend (based on typical patterns)\n\n2. **classic/** - Likely contains the classic AutoGPT implementation\n\n3. Various GitHub workflows and configuration files\n\nWhen you're ready with your requirements, I'll explore the codebase thoroughly and provide a detailed implementation plan. What would you like me to analyze or plan?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":14888,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":14888,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":204,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"10b56eac-7b09-4ee6-9c29-fe53aa0600b7","timestamp":"2025-12-09T13:35:38.298Z"}
